This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility data, which provides insights into how people's mobility patterns changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data was collected from Google Maps users around the world over several months, and location history was combined with a large number of users to capture the overall increase or decrease in time spent in various types of places.

About the Data:

The data includes information on the following categories:
Retail and recreation facilities (e.g., shopping centers, restaurants, museums)
Groceries and pharmacies
Parks
Transit stations (e.g., subway, bus, train)
Workplaces
Residences

Analysis:
Through this analysis, we aim to understand how people's mobility patterns varied over the course of the pandemic. We explore questions such as:
How did people's daily routines change during the pandemic?
Which types of places saw the most significant changes in visitation patterns?
How did mobility patterns vary across different regions and countries?

Insights:
Our analysis reveals interesting insights into how people adapted to the pandemic. Some key findings include:
Significant reductions in visits to retail and recreation facilities, as well as workplaces.
Increased time spent at home and in parks.
Changes in mobility patterns varied across regions, with some areas showing more pronounced changes than others.

Data Visualization:
To help illustrate these findings, we have included several data visualizations in this repository, including:
Time series plots showing changes in mobility patterns over time.
Heatmaps highlighting regional variations in mobility patterns.
Bar charts comparing changes in visitation patterns across different categories.

Example Use Cases
This analysis and data visualization can be useful for:
Researchers studying the impact of the pandemic on human behavior and mobility patterns
Policymakers seeking to understand how people responded to different interventions and restrictions
Business owners looking to understand changes in customer behavior and adapt their strategies accordingly
